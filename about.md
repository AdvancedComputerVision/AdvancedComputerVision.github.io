The objective of this meetup is to meet and discuss CV papers, mainly in the area of ML but sometimes (not always) an interesting off-topic ML paper is welcome. The goal is to start conversations of papers, either deep technical discussions or quick understanding of different approaches and move together towards a better understanding of the areas by sharing ideas, questions, doubts and doing projects.
