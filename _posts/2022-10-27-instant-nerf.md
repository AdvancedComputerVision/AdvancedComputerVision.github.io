# Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding

In this session, [Moritz Hambach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moritz-hambach-277326b0) and [Rishabh Raj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabhraj17/) will be leading the conversation. They will explain the main parts and logic behind the paper, show some demos and help moderate the session. These events are informal conversations where everyone has the opportunity to ask, clarify or add any type of intervention.

We welcome all levels. We strongly recommend reading the paper beforehand.

----------------- About the Hosts -----------------

Moritz works on Computer Vision and Perception for autonomous vehicles at Kopernikus. He comes from a PhD in Physics and loves improving his geometrical understanding and intuition of Deep Learning, CV and 3D representations and the corresponding algorithms (ideally unsupervised).

Rishabh is a Machine Learning and Computer vision engineer working at Kopernikus Automotive. He has his master's at TUM and previous job and research experience in Detection, Segmentation, Tracking, and Motion Prediction. He has a passion for CV and ML. His interest is in Scene Understanding using Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
