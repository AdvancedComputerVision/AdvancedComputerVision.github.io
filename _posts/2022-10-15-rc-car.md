# General Description

BTW the picture above is the car we're building

We're thinking about joining the race for [autonomous driving + robots meetup berlin](https://www.meetup.com/autonomous-robots-berlin/) and for that we need to build an RC car. Everyone in the team has something they want to experiment with, for example, a general end-to-end driving approach capable of working with on-board and off-board cameras. Everyone is welcome, we always need more hands.

If you're interested in helping us, please join the event! We have some parts of the car already built, but we still need to finish that + all the perception parts.

If you're interested, let us know! We welcome everyone who is interested in learning and/or helping us. We will be meeting usually in Berlin but sometimes online depending on the topic.

We will be posting updates of progress here.
