We read and discuss   
"End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers" 
by Nicolas Carion, Francisco Massa, Gabriel Synnaeve, Nicolas Usunier, Alexander Kirillov, Sergey Zagoruyko 
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872), May 2020.

That is going to be our first online meetup.

As a warm up we briefly discuss Transformer architecture from 
"Attention Is All You Need" 
[https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf).
