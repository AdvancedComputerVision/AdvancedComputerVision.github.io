We took the challenge of reading one paper a day for two weeks and here is the list of the papers we all read. For the sake of exactness, it was around 1 paper per day on average and we didnâ€™t need to read the same papers, some people shared some papers but in general, we were fully free to choose. 



After the 2 weeks, we made short meetings to share a very short summary of each of the papers



Here is the list
