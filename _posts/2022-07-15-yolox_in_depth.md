# Discussing YOLOX in depth

This is a second session on the last paper to discuss specific improvement in depth of this paper. We discussed the main improvemest and the reasons behind why they work and pros and cons. 

The main improvements we touch were:

* Strong data augmentation

* Decoupled heads End-to-end* (removing NMS)

* Anchor free

* Multiple positives  samples

* Optimal Transport Assignment

* 3x3 Center sampling  

* IoU on regression

YOLOX is a great paper because it groups a lot of new insights in Single Stage Detectors  (SSD) but it is also a bad paper because it does not explains any of the concepts it uses nor proposes something new.
