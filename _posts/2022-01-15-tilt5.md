# Updates:

**Note 2 (Oct, 2022):** We have received confirmation that we will receiving the glasses around January

**Note 1 (june 2021):** We have ordered a tilt5 headset to understand how it works better, if you are interested in helping us with the project or doing something related to tilt5, let us know. We are mainly localised in Berlin, Germany. You can contact us on our Meetup page or discord server (links in footer)

**Note 0:** Thanks to [Kopernikus Automotive](https://www.kopernikusauto.com/) for sponsoring this project and the Meetup.



# General Description

The [Tilt5](https://www.tiltfive.com/) system uses very clever light filters to achieve a good FOV for AR glasses using LIDOR projectors and a retro-reflective board. Apart from this, their localization takes advantage of the configuration of the whole system, mainly of the planarity of the board to localize the glasses (projectors), which simplifies slightly localization. In this project we try to replicate their approach from zero, building our own hardware (experimental version of only the projection part) and our own localization software. We leave aside the hardware optimisation because we are mainly interested in computer vision and because we donâ€™t have too many hands.  

We focus on these two aspects (hardware and localization) because we need the first to test the second and the second is a very important topic in computer vision. Nonetheless, we are also curious about how easy will it be to implement a similar approach and what else it can be used for.

The following diagram is a simplification of how the projection work

We will be posting updates of progress here.
